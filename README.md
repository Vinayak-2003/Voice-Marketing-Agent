## 🌟 The Mission: Democratizing Voice AI

The ability to create AI that can hold a natural, real-time conversation over the phone is a game-changer. But until now, this power has been locked behind expensive, proprietary, and high-latency cloud APIs.

**Voice Marketing Agents** changes that.

This project provides a complete, end-to-end, open-source solution for anyone to build and deploy their own voice AI agents. It's not just a demo; it's a production-ready foundation designed for performance, control, and infinite customizability. Whether you're a developer wanting to automate business tasks, a hobbyist exploring conversational AI, or a student learning full-stack development, this project is for you.

**This project is our submission for GSSoC '24**, built to showcase the power of a modern, open-source AI stack.

### 🔥 Core Features

*   **Blazing-Fast & Real-Time:** A meticulously tuned AI pipeline ensures a total response latency of under 2 seconds, making conversations feel fluid and natural.
*   **100% Open-Source & Self-Hosted:** No reliance on external APIs. You run everything on your own infrastructure. This means zero per-minute costs and complete data privacy.
*   **Developer-First Experience:** A fully containerized environment using Docker. The entire complex system starts with a single command.
*   **Simple Management UI:** A clean React dashboard to create, configure, and manage the "personalities" of your different voice agents.
*   **Extensible by Design:** Built with modern, standard technologies, making it easy to modify, extend, or integrate with other systems.

## 🏗️ System Architecture: A Deep Dive

The platform is designed as a set of coordinated microservices, orchestrated by Docker Compose. This modular architecture allows for scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

  ### The Life of a Single Conversational Turn

  1.  **Telephony Gateway (External):** A VoIP service (like a self-hosted Asterisk server) handles the actual phone call connection. When it's the AI's turn to speak or listen, the VoIP server makes a webhook call to our backend.
  2.  **Audio Ingestion:** The VoIP server sends the user's speech as a `.wav` file in a `multipart/form-data` request to the `/webhook` endpoint of our **FastAPI Backend**.
  3.  **STT Micro-Task (Speech-to-Text):**
      *   The backend receives the audio file.
      *   It calls the `STTService`, which is powered by **`faster-whisper`**.
      *   Using the `tiny.en` model with `int8` quantization on the CPU, it transcribes the audio to text in a few hundred milliseconds.
  4.  **LLM Micro-Task (Reasoning & Response Generation):**
      *   The transcribed text is passed to the `LLMService`.
      *   This service constructs a prompt (including system instructions and conversation history) and sends it to the **Ollama** container.
      *   The **`TinyLlama`** model, running inside Ollama, generates the text for the agent's response, typically in under a second.
  5.  **TTS Micro-Task (Text-to-Speech):**
      *   The LLM's text response is sent to the `TTSService`.
      *   The **`Coqui TTS`** engine synthesizes this text into a high-quality audio waveform.
      *   The resulting audio is saved as a temporary file accessible by the backend.
  6.  **Webhook Response:** The FastAPI backend responds to the initial webhook request from the Telephony Gateway, providing a URL to the newly generated audio file. The gateway then plays this audio to the user over the phone.

  This entire end-to-end process is optimized to complete in **under 2 seconds**, which is crucial for maintaining a natural conversational rhythm.

## 🚀 The Tech Stack: Why We Chose These Tools

Every technology in this stack was deliberately chosen for performance, community support, and its open-source nature.

| Component      | Technology                                    | Rationale & Key Benefits                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frontend**   | **React & Vite**                              | **Speed & Simplicity.** React provides a robust component model, while Vite offers a lightning-fast development server and optimized builds for a lightweight dashboard. |
| **Backend**    | **Python & FastAPI**                          | **Asynchronous Performance.** FastAPI's async/await syntax is perfect for I/O-bound AI tasks, preventing the server from blocking while models are processing. |
| **STT Engine** | **`faster-whisper` (`tiny.en`)**              | **Extreme Speed.** A CTranslate2 re-implementation of Whisper that's up to 4x faster on CPU. `tiny.en` is all we need for high-accuracy English transcription. |
| **LLM Engine** | **Ollama with `TinyLlama`**                   | **Efficiency & Control.** Ollama makes serving LLMs effortless. `TinyLlama` is a small yet powerful model with minimal inference latency, ideal for real-time chat. |
| **TTS Engine** | **`Coqui TTS` (VITS Model)**                  | **Quality & Flexibility.** Coqui's VITS models offer a fantastic balance between natural-sounding, human-like voice and fast synthesis speeds on CPU. |
| **Database**   | **PostgreSQL**                                | **Reliability.** A battle-tested, robust relational database for storing agent configurations, call logs, and user data securely. |
| **Infra**      | **Docker & Docker Compose**                   | **Reproducibility.** This is the magic that makes it all work. It packages every service and its dependencies into isolated containers for a flawless, one-command setup. |
